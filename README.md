> It is the year 3360 on the planet of Vallene. This small planet in ancient times used to be a barren wasteland with people fighting in endless sand dunes, until “Dawn” appeared. Dawn, a flying castle which appeared 5,000 years ago, shifted the weather, and created seasons. Since then, Dawn has been controlled by a Royal family since the beginning, led by the chosen sovereign, who is given the title of “Maestro”. Our story begins when the most recent sovereign has died. An Empress loved by her people.
